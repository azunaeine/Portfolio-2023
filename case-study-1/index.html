          clear <strong>understanding</strong> of its buttons, and experienced
          <strong>smooth transitioning </strong> between different pages. The

        <p class="reflection">
          Designing this mobile application was a challenging process that
          demanded a lot of patience and hard work. I had to create many
          different screens for the app and pay close attention to every detail.
          Doing the same thing over and over again was tiring, and I realized
          the importance of taking care of myself and managing my time well.
          Making something that looks beautiful and appealing takes a lot of
          time and effort. In the future, I'll remember to balance my creativity
          with self-care to stay productive and healthy while working on design
          projects.
