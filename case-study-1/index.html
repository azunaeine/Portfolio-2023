        In the summer of 2023, I developed a mobile application aimed at

        clothing items from their preferred stores, facilitating convenient
        delivery to their doorstep without the need for in-person visits to the
        retail establishments.

      <p>
        When shopping for clothing, visiting a physical store presents several
        drawbacks. These challenges encompass the need to physically travel to
        the store, maneuver through crowded aisles, and endure lengthy wait
        times in queues.

      <h3 class="summary">The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        My solution aims to address the challenges associated with shopping for
        clothing in physical stores. By leveraging technology and e-commerce,
        Levitate provides a convenient and efficient alternative that eliminates
        the need for customers to physically travel to stores, navigate crowded
        aisles, and endure lengthy wait times in queues. Through the platform,
        users can browse and purchase clothing items from the comfort of their
        own homes, benefiting from a seamless online shopping experience and
        doorstep delivery.

      In order to gather additional data, I conducted a survey and distributed
      it on various social media platforms. The purpose of the survey was to
      gauge the general inclination of individuals towards using mobile
      applications for receiving clothes through delivery services. The survey
      yielded the following significant findings:
    </p>
    <div class="find-flex">
      <p class="finding">
        <strong>Finding 1:</strong> The survey revealed that a majority of
        individuals prefer using mobile applications for receiving clothes
        through delivery services, indicating a growing trend in online shopping
        convenience.
      </p>
      <p class="finding">
        <strong>Finding 2:</strong> Among the surveyed participants, the younger
        demographic showed a higher inclination towards using mobile
        applications for receiving clothes, suggesting a shift in consumer
        behavior driven by technology adoption.
      </p>
      <p class="finding">
        <strong>Finding 3:</strong> The survey findings highlighted specific
        features and benefits that users value in mobile applications for
        receiving clothes, such as ease of use, quick delivery, and a wide range
        of available clothing options. These insights can inform the development
        and improvement of mobile app features in the e-commerce clothing
        industry.

        During the survey, participants were queried regarding their shopping
        habits, including frequency and preference for online versus physical
        store purchases. A significant majority expressed a preference for
        shopping in online clothing stores.
      </p>

      <img src="/images/circle2.svg" class="diagram" />

      <p>
        As part of the survey, participants were requested to provide ratings on
        a scale of 1-10 for their previous experiences with online clothing
        shopping stores. The analysis revealed that a majority of participants
        had positive experiences. Notably, the younger demographic exhibited a
        more enthusiastic response towards shopping in online clothing stores.
      </p>

      <img src="/images/circle3.svg" class="diagram" />

      <p>
        In the survey conducted on online clothing stores, 100% of the
        participants highlighted the significance of expedited delivery or
        doorstep delivery options. They expressed their dissatisfaction with the
        extended shipping times provided by clothing stores.
