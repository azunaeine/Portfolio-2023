          <p class="oldpar">
            The visual aesthetics of this Hub page are subpar and unappealing
            primarily due to the absence of color elements, resulting in
            challenges in effectively differentiating information.

          <h4 class="old">New Hub page</h4>
          <p class="oldpar">
            I successfully enhanced the visual aesthetics of the Hub page by
            implementing a strategic incorporation of color elements and an
            intuitive design concept, resulting in a more appealing overall
            appearance. The revamp accentuates key elements and improves the Hub
            page's recognition.

          After finalizing the high-fidelity design, the visual system was
          established to create a cohesive visual identity centered around a
          simple color palette and enriched by contemporary design elements. The
          visual system directly resulted from the comprehensive high-fidelity
          design and aimed to enhance the overall aesthetics and user
          experience.

        <p class="test">
          Before finalizing this project, a usability test was conducted to
          evaluate the usability and user experience of the product. Users were
          observed and their feedback was collected as they interacted with the
          product and performed specific tasks. The purpose of the usability
          test was to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of
          the user interaction with the product.

          The usability tests yielded favorable outcomes, as all participants
          demonstrated effortless navigation within the mobile application
          without encountering any notable issues or errors. The users
          successfully navigated the app, displaying a clear understanding of
          its buttons and the process of transitioning between different pages
          within the mobile application.

        <p class="reflection">
          Designing this mobile application was a challenging process that
          demanded a lot of patience and hard work. I had to create many
          different screens for the app and pay close attention to every detail.
          Doing the same thing over and over again was tiring, and I realized
          the importance of taking care of myself and managing my time well.
          Making something that looks beautiful and appealing takes a lot of
          time and effort. In the future, I'll remember to balance my creativity
          with self-care to stay productive and healthy while working on design
          projects.
