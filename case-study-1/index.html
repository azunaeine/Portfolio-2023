            The visual aesthetics of this Hub page are subpar and unappealing
            primarily due to the absence of color elements, resulting in
            challenges in effectively differentiating information.

          <p class="oldpar">
            I successfully enhanced the visual aesthetics of the Hub page by
            implementing a strategic incorporation of color elements and an
            intuitive design concept, resulting in a more appealing overall
            appearance. The revamp accentuates key elements and improves the Hub
            page's recognition.

          After finalizing the high-fidelity design, the visual system was
          established to create a cohesive visual identity centered around a
          simple color palette and enriched by contemporary design elements. The
          visual system directly resulted from the comprehensive high-fidelity
          design and aimed to enhance the overall aesthetics and user
          experience.

        <p class="test">
          Before finalizing this project, I conducted usability tests to
          evaluate the product's usability and user experience. Throughout these
          tests, I closely observed users as they interacted with the product
          and engaged in specific tasks, such as finding clothing items,
          navigating to the "My Shopping Cart" page, and exploring various
          clothing categories. My primary objective with these usability tests
          was to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and overall satisfaction
          of the user interaction with the product.

          As a result of conducting thorough usability tests, the mobile
          application received favorable feedback. All participants demonstrated
          effortless navigation within the app, displaying a clear understanding
          of its buttons, and experienced smooth transitioning between different
          pages. The positive outcomes from the usability tests confirmed that
          the implemented design iterations had a significant impact on
          enhancing the overall user experience.

        <h3 class="headline">Reflection</h3>
        <p class="reflection">
          Designing this mobile application was a challenging process that
          demanded a lot of patience and hard work. I had to create many
          different screens for the app and pay close attention to every detail.
          Doing the same thing over and over again was tiring, and I realized
          the importance of taking care of myself and managing my time well.
          Making something that looks beautiful and appealing takes a lot of
          time and effort. In the future, I'll remember to balance my creativity
          with self-care to stay productive and healthy while working on design
          projects.
